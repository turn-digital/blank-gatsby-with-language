Preparation together with the client is key, and I can also help out with the event itself if necessary thanks to my extensive experience as a PR consultant.

  "Review_2_Content": "<p>In 2016, we took on the task to organize for the first time a scholarship contest for IT students, which has traditionally included an awards ceremony. As we had little time to organize the event, we took the advice of the previous organizers to invite Artis as the event host. Artis not only contributed as an event host, but also read all the thesis papers and prepared questions for the students to improve the engagement with the audience. Artis is highly capable to respond to unplanned situations and engage with the audience. We will continue working with Artis in future events and we recommend him to others as well!</p>",
