  "Review_1_Content": "<p>We organized a public discussion for our client about e-scooters to create the basis for further discussions on changes to the relevant regulatory framework.

Last but not least, as a customer, we highly appreciated the fact that Artis went into the substance of the topic in preparation for the discussion and provided his vision on the format and content of the discussion.</p>",
